# MyBlog
Backend Application of My-Blog
Description: The blog project I developed using Java and the Spring Framework is a dynamic web application that allows users to create and manage simple text-based posts and engage in discussions through comments. It utilizes a RESTful API architecture, providing a seamless and interactive experience for both bloggers and readers.
Key Features:

Post Creation and Management: Bloggers can create new posts, specifying a title and content for each entry. The application stores these posts in a database, ensuring persistent data storage and easy retrieval.

Commenting System: Readers can engage with the blog posts by adding comments. The project supports threaded comments, allowing for nested discussions and enhancing the interactivity of the platform.
